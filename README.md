    What is FFARush ?

This plugin is designed to work in a free game mode with an auto deletion system of owned blocks and customizable tnt.

It is designed to run on its own server (for the moment anyway).

You can create an infinite number of spawn points, kits and custom inventory at the spawn to make the game as profitable as possible for the player.

    How does it work?

1. Download the plugin jar and place it in your plugins folder.
2. Restart the server.
3. Setup the lobby spawn and all other spawn.
4. Modify the plugin config or create new kits if you want to.
5. Enjoy ! (y)

Commands:
- /ffarush play = Makes you join the game
- /ffarush setspawn <SpawnName> = Register a new spawn location
- /ffarush setlobby = Registers the location of the lobby
- /ffarush setkit <KitName> = Save your inventory in a kit.
- /ffarush kits = Opens an inventory displaying all kits
- /ffarush reload = Reload the plugin files

Permissions:

I hope my plugin will help you, don't hesitate to make a feedback on it or to suggest improvements.
